Description: A formalisation of Burali-Forti paradox in system U (the
existence of an ordinal of ordinals is inconsistent), of Diaconescu
paradox (axiom of choice implies excluded-middle), of Reynolds paradox
(there is no set-theoretic model of system F) and Hurkens paradox in
system U (adapted by H. Geuvers to show the inconsistency of 
Excluded-Middle in impredicative-Set Calculus of Inductive Constructions).
Keywords: Reynolds paradox, Burali-Forti paradox, Diaconescu paradox, set theory, system U, inconsistency, Hurkens paradox
